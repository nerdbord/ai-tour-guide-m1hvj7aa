# AI Tour Guide

## Project Brief

Welcome to the AI Tour Guide Hackathon!

Your goal is to create an AI-powered tour guide that offers hyperpersonalized tours based on user preferences. Users can set up a new tour, choose the language of the lector, and then start their personalized tour. As they walk through cities, the AI tour guide will provide interesting information through their headphones.

In this project, you will integrate Google Maps API, Eleven Labs, and OpenAI to deliver a seamless and engaging tour experience. This project will help you develop skills in API integration, natural language processing, and real-time data handling.

Remember, a repository will be generated for this project, and you will find all the necessary files to get started.

7. **Integrate OpenAI**: Generate personalized tour content based on user preferences and location data.
8. **Test the AI Tour Guide**: Ensure all functionalities work as expected. Document any issues and fix them.
9. **Deploy the Project**: Deploy the AI tour guide project to a live environment.
